# helmcharts
Helm charts used by TeknofileNet

There's a lot of work to be done here. Several of the charts are working in a very basic form, for my use. There will probably need to have some work to make them generalized for everyday consumption. If you're interested in using them, let me know.

Charts that I have working (and am running them personally in my own systems):

- tkf-docker-calibre-web
- tkf-docker-heimdall
- tkf-docker-lum
- tkf-docker-nzbget
- tkf-docker-radarr
- tkf-docker-sonarr
- tkf-docker-smokeping
- tkf-docker-piwigo
- tkf-docker-registry
